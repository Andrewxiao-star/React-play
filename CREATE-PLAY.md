### Steps to Create a Play
Welcome developers! Here are some things you can do to get started with your `Play` creation.

- Open a command prompt in your project folder.
- Run the following command:
  ```shell
    yarn install
    # or
    npm install
  ```
- After the installation is complete, run the following command:
  ```shell
    yarn plop
  ```
- This will ask a few questions about your `Play` and then perform required steps to create the play. The screen shot below shows the output of the command.

- Now you can run the app using the following command:
  ```shell
    yarn start
    # or
    npm start
  ```
- You can now see your play added to the [play board](http://localhost:3000/plays) page. You can click on the play thumbnail to see the details of the play.
