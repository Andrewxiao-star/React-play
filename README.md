The `movie-app` is a React project to deomonstrate the well-known React patterns like,


- [X] Container Component Pattern
- [ ] Higher-Order Component Pattern
- [ ] Render prop
- [ ] Proxy Component
- [ ] Event Switch
- [ ] Layout Coponent
- [ ] State Hoisting 
... many more

I'll be creating articles and/or videos on each of the above patterns using the code from this repository.
