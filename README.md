## 👋 Introducing ReactPlay

<p align="center">
  <img src="src/images/og-image.png" alt="name"/>
</p>

`react-play` is an `opensource` web app that helps you learn ReactJS faster with hands-on practice model. It is a collection of `ReactJS projects` that you can use to learn ReactJS.

Is that all? Nope. You can also create your own projects and share them with the world. The best part is that the ReactJS experts will `review` your project code before it gets part of the `ReactPlay` app. Isn't that a pure WIN-WIN?
# 🚀 Demo
Here is the link to the app. We hope you enjoy it.

# 🏗️ How to Set up `ReactPlay` for Development?

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Install
Use the `yarn install` or `npm install` command to install dependencies.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn plop`

Create a new play using this command. Just answer a few questions to get started.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
