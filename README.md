The `react-play` is a React project to deomonstrate the well-known React patterns like,


- [X] [Container Component Pattern](https://github.com/atapas/react-play/tree/release/openreplay-cc-pattern)
- [ ] Higher-Order Component Pattern
- [ ] Render prop
- [ ] Proxy Component
- [ ] Event Switch
- [ ] Layout Coponent
- [ ] State Hoisting 
... many more

I'll be creating articles ✍️ and/or videos 📹 on each of the above patterns using the code from this repository.

# 🏗️ Getting Started with `react-play`

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Install
Use the `yarn install` or `npm install` command to install dependencies.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
