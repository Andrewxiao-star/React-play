# Quizeo

Quizeo is a react fun project to play quiz around favourite movies and series, if you have watched.

## What you will learn
The app demonstrates 
- the use of reusable components, shows you how to divide your react app into components
- use of react-redux
- use of react-redux with hooks
- use of react-router for routing
- use of reselect for better memoization and cache management
- use of ES6 features

The app starts with the routing page RouteDef and expanded into the components of the Quizeo App. The data of the questions and their answers are stored in the different file and added to the gitignore. 

The app uses redux store to store the state and data of the app globally and is fetched with the help of selectors 'react-reselect' to implement memoization to the app. Also each component contains its own CSS for easy implementation of design.

Happy learning!
