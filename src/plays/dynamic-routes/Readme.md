## Implementation Details

to get the url input paramete value we need to tweak the path of the this project in the play-mets.js file
from ""/plays/dynamic-routes/" to "/plays/dynamic-routes/:menu"
we need to use useParams() hook to get the input value of url and pass to our filter function we can fetch the recipes based input value. if our input matches the meal categories. we show the data on screen.
